/* system.h — the PicoCalc's own commands (design.md §4.5): `help`
 * (`man` in the UNIX flavour), `clear`, `phosphor`, `battery`,
 * `backlight`, `info`, `poweroff`, `reboot` and `bootsel`; and the UNIX
 * flavour's `date`, and the W build's `ntp` (design.md §3.8).
 *
 * Portable: the southbridge, the terminal's ink and the reboots are the
 * port's, through shell_system_t (shell.h). With a hook missing, as on
 * the host, its command says it cannot be done here.
 *
 * `poweroff`, `reboot` and `bootsel` leave the shell: each saves the
 * history first, as running a program does, and is refused with a
 * redirection or in a pipe. `reboot` comes back to the shell, not the
 * last program (design.md §3.1). */
