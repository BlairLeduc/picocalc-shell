/* parse.h — one typed line into commands (design.md §4.4).
 *
 * Words with '…' and "…" quoting and \ escapes, `#` comments, the
 * separators `;`, `&&`, `||` and `|`, and the redirections `>`, `>>` and
 * `<`. Words are kept as typed, quotes and all: variables and globs are
 * expanded, and quotes removed, as each command runs (expand.h), so
 * `cd x; ls *` and `false; echo $?` see what the command before did.
 *
 * The whole line is parsed before anything runs, so a mistake at its end
 * stops all of it, as in sh. */
