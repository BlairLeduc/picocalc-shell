/* uf2.h — a UF2 program: the check before flash is touched, and the
 * differential flash (design.md §3.3).
 *
 * Portable: the file comes through FatFs, and the flash through
 * uf2_flash_t, which is the port's bootrom calls on the board and an
 * array on the host. The rules for blocks are UF2 Loader's
 * (references/uf2loader/ui/uf2.c), with three differences: the whole
 * file is checked before anything is erased; blocks must ascend; and a
 * sector that already holds what the program puts there is not written.
 *
 * Two passes. uf2_check reads every block and checks it, and compares
 * each 4 KB sector the program covers with flash; it only reads. If any
 * sector differs, uf2_write reads the file again and writes just those
 * sectors. The program's first sector, which holds its IMAGE_DEF, is
 * erased before any other and written last, the page that starts the
 * IMAGE_DEF last of all, so a write cut short leaves no bootable image
 * and stage3 falls back to /BOOT2350.UF2, the shell. */
