/* expand.h — a command's words as it runs: variables, quotes, globs
 * (design.md §4.4).
 *
 * The parser keeps each word as typed (parse.h). Here, as the command
 * runs:
 *   - `$NAME`, `${NAME}` and `$?` are replaced, outside single quotes. A
 *     `$` before anything else is itself. An unset variable is empty.
 *   - quotes and escapes are removed.
 *   - a word with `*`, `?` or `[` outside quotes, in its last name, is a
 *     glob: it becomes the names in that directory that match, sorted as
 *     ls sorts them, or stays as it is if none does. Hidden names
 *     (design.md §4.2) match only a pattern that starts with '.'.
 *   - a word left empty that had no quotes is dropped, as in sh.
 * A variable's value is never split into words or globbed. */
