/* lcd.h — ST7789P/ST7365P-class 320x320 panel on spi1 (hardware-notes.md §4).
 *
 * From pico-oric's src/port/lcd.h (GPL-3.0, the owner's), with hardware
 * vertical scroll added for the terminal (design.md §4.1; §4.8).
 *
 * Only ever touched from thread context, never from an interrupt handler.
 * Nothing here masks interrupts: the controller tolerates SPI clock
 * pauses mid-window.
 *
 * Every y here is a panel row, 0-319. The window setup alone maps it
 * through the scroll offset into frame memory, wrapping at 480 rows
 * (hardware-notes.md §4.8), so no caller sees the offset.

 * this one, so with two line buffers the caller always fills the one that
 * is not on the wire. Sending the same buffer twice in a row is allowed:
 * a blit may repeat a row without refilling it.
 *
 * A blit is one window, so it must not cross the wrap in frame memory.
 * The terminal's text rows never do: the offset moves in whole 10-pixel
 * rows and 480 is a whole number of them. */
